# cutest: C Unit Testing Framework

`cutest` (CuTest) is used to write unit tests for C code. It can be compiled as
a static library and linked to the executable that contains the unit test code.

`cutest` was originally developed by Asim Jalis. The original releases are
available via [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cutest/). The
SourceForge releases are no longer maintained. This repository extends the
original CuTest, modernizing the code and tools and fixing bugs.

For additional details about usage, see the original [README.txt](README.txt).

# Modifications from the Original `cutest`
